### Q8.1

Modify Program 8.1 so that the user can enter both positive and negative numbers (including zero). In order to facilitate this, the user will first enter a number indicating the number of elements of the array that he or she is going to enter next. For example, in the input

```
	5 1987 âˆ’265 1349 0 5674
```

the first number 5 indicates the number of array entries to follow. Your program should perform array bound checks.
