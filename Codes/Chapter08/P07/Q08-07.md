### Q8.7

Merge sort is a technique to combine two sorted arrays. Merge sort takes two sorted input arrays ```X``` and ```Y```—say of size ```m``` and ```n```—and produces a sorted array ```Z``` of size ```m+n``` that contains all elements of the two input arrays. The pseudocode of merge sort is as follows:

```pseudocode
mergesort (X, Y, Z, m, n)
    i := 0 {index variables for arrays X, Y, and Z}
    j := 0
    k := 0
    while ((i < m) AND (j < n))
        if (X[i] ≤ Y[j]) {find largest of two}
        then
            Z[k] := X[i] {copy and update indices}
            k := k+1
            i := i+1
        else
            Z[k] := Y[j] {copy and update indices}
            k := k+1
            j := j+1
        end if
    end while
    if (i < m) {copy remainder of input array}
        while (i < m)
            Z[k] := X[i]
            k := k+1
            i := i+1
        end while
    else
        while (j < n)
            Z[k] := Y[j]
            k := k+1
            j := j+1
        end while
    end if
end mergesort
```

The merge sort algorithm scans the two input arrays while copying the smallest of the two elements from X and Y into Z. It updates indices appropriately. The first while loop terminates when one of the arrays is exhausted. Then the other array is copied into Z. Write a merge sort procedure and test it with two sorted arrays. Assume that the user enters the two input arrays in sorted (ascending) order. The merge sort procedure receives the five parameters via the stack.
