### Q8.5

Do the last exercise using an indirect jump. Hint: Use ```xlat``` to translate vowels to five consecutive numbers so that you can use the number as an index into the jump table.

#### Last Exercise (Q8.4)

Write an assembly language program to read a string of characters from the user and that prints the vowel count. For each vowel, the count includes both uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, the input string

```
	Advanced Programming in UNIX Environment
```

produces the following output:

```
	Vowel 	Count
	a or A 	  3
	e or E    3
	i or I    4
	o or O    2
	u or U    1
```
