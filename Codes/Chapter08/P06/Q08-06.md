### Q8.6

Suppose that we want to list each uppercase and lowercase vowel separately (i.e., a total of 10 count values). Modify the programs of the last two exercises to do this. After doing this exercise, express your opinion on the usefulness of the indirect jump instruction.

#### Last two Exercises

##### Q8.5

Do the last exercise using an indirect jump. Hint: Use ```xlat``` to translate vowels to five consecutive numbers so that you can use the number as an index into the jump table.

##### Q8.4

Write an assembly language program to read a string of characters from the user and that prints the vowel count. For each vowel, the count includes both uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, the input string

```
	Advanced Programming in UNIX Environment
```

produces the following output:

```
	Vowel 	Count
	a or A 	  3
	e or E    3
	i or I    4
	o or O    2
	u or U    1
```
