### Q9.5

Suppose you are given an integer that requires 16 bits to store. You are asked to find whether its binary representation has an odd or even number of 1’s. Write a program to read an integer (should accept both positive and negative numbers) from the user and outputs whether it contains an odd or even number 1’s. Your program should also print the number of 1’s in the binary representation.
