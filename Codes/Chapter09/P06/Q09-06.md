### Q9.6

Write a procedure `abs` that receives an 8-bit signed number in the AL register and returns its absolute value back in the same register. Remember that negative numbers are stored in 2â€™s complement representation. It is simple to write such a procedure using arithmetic instructions. In this exercise, however, you are asked to write this procedure using *only the logical* instructions.
