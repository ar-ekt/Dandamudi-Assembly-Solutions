### Q9.8

Display the status of the flags register. In particular, display the status of the carry, parity, zero, and sign flags. (See Chapters 3 and 7 for details on the flags register.) For each flag, use the format “flag = value”. For example, if carry flag is set, your program should display “CF = 1”. Each flag status should be displayed on a separate line. Before terminating your program, the four flag bits should be complemented and stored back in the flags register.
