### Q9.9

Repeat the last exercise using the `lahf` and `sahf` instructions. The details of these instructions are as follows: the `lahf` (Load AH from Flags register) copies the lowerorder byte of the flags register into the AH register. The `sahf` (Store AH to Flags register) stores the contents of the AH register in the lower-order byte of the flags register.

#### Last Exercise (Q9.8)

Display the status of the flags register. In particular, display the status of the carry, parity, zero, and sign flags. (See Chapters 3 and 7 for details on the flags register.) For each flag, use the format “flag = value”. For example, if carry flag is set, your program should display “CF = 1”. Each flag status should be displayed on a separate line. Before terminating your program, the four flag bits should be complemented and stored back in the flags register.
