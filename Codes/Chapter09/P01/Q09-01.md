### Q9.1

Write a procedure to perform hexadecimal-to-binary conversion. Use only shift instructions for multiplication. Assume that signed 32-bit numbers are used. Test your procedure by writing a main program that reads a hexadecimal number as a character string and converts it to an equivalent binary number by calling the procedure. Finally, the main program should display the decimal value of the input by using `PutLInt`.
