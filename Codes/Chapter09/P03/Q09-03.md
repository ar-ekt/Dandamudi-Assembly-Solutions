### Q9.3

In Appendix A, we discuss the format of short floating-point numbers. Write a program that reads the floating-point internal representation from a user as a string of eight hexadecimal digits and displays the three components—mantissa, exponent, and sign—in binary. For example, if the input to the program is 429DA000, the output should be
```
sign = 0
mantissa = 1.0011101101
exponent = 110
```
