### Q14.5

Linux provides two system calls to create and remove a directory. Details about these system calls are given below:

#### System call 39 — Creates a directory
```
	 Inputs: 	EAX = 39
			EBX = path
			ECX = permissions
	Returns: 	EAX = 0 if no error
	  Error: 	EAX = error code
```

This function creates the directory given in the path (a pointer to a character string like the filenames). For details on permissions, see our discussion for the file-create system call. If the call is successful, it returns 0 in EAX. Otherwise, it returns an error code as in other system calls.

The system call to remove a directory is similar (it does not require permissions):

#### System call 40 — Removes a directory
```
	 Inputs: 	EAX = 40
			EBX = path
	Returns: 	EAX = 0 if no error
	  Error: 	EAX = error code
```

Write two procedures: one to create and the other to remove a directory. Each procedure takes a pointer to a path and creates the directory. (The create directory procedure uses default permissions.) You should also write a main program to test the procedure. Devise suitable error reporting mechanism (see the last exercise).
