### Q5.7

Write a procedure `locate` to locate a character in a given string. The procedure receives a pointer to a NULL-terminated character string and the character to be located. When the first occurrence of the character is located, its position is returned to `main`. If no match is found, a negative value is returned. The `main` procedure requests a character string and a character to be located and displays the position of the first occurrence of the character returned by the `locate` procedure. If there is no match, a message should be displayed to that effect.
