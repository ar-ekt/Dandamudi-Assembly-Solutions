### Q5.6

Write a procedure to perform string reversal. The procedure `reverse` receives a pointer to a character string (terminated by a NULL character) and reverses the string. For example, if the original string is
```
slap
```
the reversed string should read
```
pals
```
The `main` procedure should request the string from the user. It should also display the reversed string as output of the program.
