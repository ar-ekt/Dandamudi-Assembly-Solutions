### Q5.4

Extend the last exercise to return both maximum and minimum of the three integers received by your procedure `minmax`. In order to return the minimum and maximum values, your procedure `minmax` also receives two pointers from main to variables `min_int` and `max_int`.

#### Last Exercise (Q5.3)

Write a procedure `max` that receives three integers from `main` and returns the maximum of the three in AX. The `main` procedure requests the three integers from the user and displays the maximum number returned by the `max` procedure.
