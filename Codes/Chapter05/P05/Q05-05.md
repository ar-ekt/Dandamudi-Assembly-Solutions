### Q5.5

Extend the last exercise to handle variable number of integers passed on to the `minmax` procedure. The `main` procedure should request input integers from the user. Positive or negative values, except zero, are valid. Entering a zero terminates the input integer sequence. The minimum and maximum values returned by the procedure are displayed by `main`.

#### Last Exercise
##### Q5.4

Extend the last exercise to return both maximum and minimum of the three integers received by your procedure `minmax`. In order to return the minimum and maximum values, your procedure `minmax` also receives two pointers from main to variables `min_int` and `max_int`.

##### Q5.3

Write a procedure `max` that receives three integers from `main` and returns the maximum of the three in AX. The `main` procedure requests the three integers from the user and displays the maximum number returned by the `max` procedure.
