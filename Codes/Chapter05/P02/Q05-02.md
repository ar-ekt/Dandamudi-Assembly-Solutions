### Q5.2


Write an assembly language program that reads a set of integers from the keyboard and displays their sum on the screen. Your program should read up to 20 integers (except zero) from the user. The input can be terminated by entering a zero or by entering 20 integers. The array of input integers is passed along with its size to the `sum` procedure, which returns the sum in the AX register. Your `sum` procedure need not check for overflow.
