### Q11.8

Write an assembly language program to perform multiplication in ASCII representation. In this exercise, assume that the multiplier is a single digit. The two numbers to be multiplied are given as input in the ASCII form (your program reads them using `GerStr`). The result should be displayed by using `PutStr`.   
**Hint:** *You need to use a loop that mimics the behavior of the longhand multiplication (i.e., multiply one digit at a time).*
