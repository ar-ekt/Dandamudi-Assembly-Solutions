### Q11.9

Write an assembly language program to perform multiplication in ASCII representation. Unlike in the last exercise, both numbers can be multidigit (up to 5 digits) numbers. The two numbers to be multiplied are given as input in the ASCII form (your program reads them using `GerStr`). The result should be displayed by using `PutStr`.
**Hint:** *You need two (nested) loops, where the inner loop is similar to that in the last exercise.*

#### last exercise (Q11.8)

Write an assembly language program to perform multiplication in ASCII representation. In this exercise, assume that the multiplier is a single digit. The two numbers to be multiplied are given as input in the ASCII form (your program reads them using `GerStr`). The result should be displayed by using `PutStr`.   
**Hint:** *You need to use a loop that mimics the behavior of the longhand multiplication (i.e., multiply one digit at a time).*
