### Q4.1

Modify the program of Example 4.6 so that, in response to the query

	Do you want to quit (Y/N):

the program terminates only if the response is Y or y; continues with a request for
another character only if the response to the query is N or n; otherwise, repeats the
query.

#### Example 4.6 *ASCII to binary conversion*

The goal of this example is to illustrate how the logical ```test``` instruction can be used to test
a bit. The program reads a key from the keyboard and displays its ASCII code in binary. It
then queries the user as to whether he or she wants to quit. Depending on the response, the program either requests another character input from the keyboard, or terminates.
To display the binary value of the ASCII code of the input key, we test each bit starting
with the most significant bit (i.e., leftmost bit). The ```mask``` is initialized to 80H (=10000000B), which tests only the value of the most significant bit of the ASCII value. If this bit is 0, the code

```assembly
 test AL,mask
```

sets the ZF (assuming that the ASCII value is in the AL register). In this case, a 0 is displayed by directing the program flow using the jz instruction (line 29). Otherwise, a 1 is displayed.
The ```mask``` is then divided by 2, which is equivalent to right-shifting ```mask``` by one bit position. Thus, we are ready for testing the second most significant bit. The process is repeated for each bit of the ASCII value. The pseudocode of the program is as follows.

```pseudocode
main()
read_char:
	display prompt message
	read input character into char
	display output message text
	mask := 80H {AH is used to store mask}
	count := 8 {ECX is used to store count}
	repeat
		if ((char AND mask) = 0)
		then
			write 0
		else
			write 1
		end if
		mask := mask/2 {can be done by shr}
		count := count − 1
	until (count = 0)
	display query message
	read response
	if (response = ’Y’)
	then
		goto done
	else
		goto read_char
	end if
done:
	return
end main
```

The assembly language program, shown in Program 4.1, follows the pseudo-code in a
straightforward way. Note that Pentium provides an instruction to perform integer division.
However, to divide a number by 2, ```shr``` is much faster than the divide instruction. More
details about the division instructions are given in Chapter 7.
