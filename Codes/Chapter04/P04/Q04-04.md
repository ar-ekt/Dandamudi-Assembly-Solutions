### Q4.4

Write an assembly language program to encrypt digits as shown below:

​						 input digit:	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
​				encrypted digit:	4 6 9 5 0 3 1 8 7 2

Briefly discuss whether or not you would use the ```xlat``` instruction. Your program should accept a string consisting of digit and nondigit characters. The encrypted string should be displayed in which only the digits are affected. Then the user should be queried whether he or she wants to terminate the program. If the response is either ’y’ or ’Y’ you should terminate the program; otherwise, you should request another input string from the keyboard.
The encryption scheme given here has the property that when you encrypt an already encrypted string, you get back the original string. Use this property to verify your program.
