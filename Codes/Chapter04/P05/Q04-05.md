### Q4.5

Using only the assembly language instructions discussed so far, write a program to accept a number in hexadecimal form and display the decimal equivalent of the number. A typical interaction of your program is (user input is shown in bold):

​				Please input a positive number in hex (4 digits max.): **A10F**
​				The decimal equivalent of A10FH is 41231
​				Do you want to terminate the program (Y/N): **Y**

You should refer to Appendix A for an algorithm to convert from base b to decimal.
*Hints*:

1. Required multiplication can be done by the ```shl``` instruction.
2. Once you have converted the hex number into the equivalent in binary using the algorithm of Appendix A, you can use the ```PutInt``` routine to display the decimal equivalent.
