Modify Program 6.3 to read array input data from the user. Your program should be able to accept up to 25 nonzero numbers from the user. A zero terminates the input. Report error if more than 25 numbers are given.

#### Example 6.3 Finding the sum of a one-dimensional array.

This example shows how one-dimensional arrays can be manipulated. Program 6.3 finds the sum of the `test_marks` array and displays the result.

##### Program 6.3 Computing the sum of a one-dimensional array

```assembly
01: ;Sum of a long integer array    ARAY_SUM.ASM
02: ;
03: ; 		Objective: To find sum of all elements of an array.
04: ;   	    Input: None.
05: ; 		   Output: Displays the sum.
06: %include "io.mac"

08: .DATA
09: test_marks 	dd  90,50,70,94,81,40,67,55,60,73
10: NO_STUDENTS EQU ($-test_marks)/4                ; number of students
11: sum_msg     db  ’The sum of test marks is: ’,0

13: .CODE
14: 	.STARTUP
15: 	mov ECX,NO_STUDENTS 	                   ; loop iteration count
16: 	sub EAX,EAX 			           ; sum = 0
17: 	sub ESI,ESI 			           ; array index = 0
18: add_loop:
19: 	mov EBX,[test_marks+ESI*4]
20: 	PutLInt EBX
21: 	nwln
22: 	add EAX,[test_marks+ESI*4]
23: 	inc ESI
24: 	loop add_loop
25:
26: 	PutStr sum_msg
27: 	PutLInt EAX
28: 	nwln
29: 	.EXIT
```

Each element of the `test_marks` array, declared on line 9, requires four bytes. The array size `NO_STUDENTS` is computed on line 10 using the predefined location counter symbol `$`. The symbol `$` is always set to the current offset in the segment. Thus, on line 10, `$` points to the byte after the array storage space. Therefore, (`$-test_marks`) gives the storage space in bytes, and dividing this value by four gives the number of elements in the array. The indexed addressing mode with a scale factor of four is used on lines 19 and 22. Remember that the scale factor is only allowed in the 32-bit mode. As a result, we have to use ESI rather than the SI register.
