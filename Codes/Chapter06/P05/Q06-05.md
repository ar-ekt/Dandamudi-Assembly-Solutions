Write a procedure to perform multiplication of matrices **A** and **B**. The procedure should receive pointers to the two input matrices (**A** of size $l×m$, **B** of size $m×n$), the product matrix **C**, and values $l$, $m$, and $n$. Also, the data for the two matrices should be obtained from the user. Devise a suitable user interface to read these numbers.
