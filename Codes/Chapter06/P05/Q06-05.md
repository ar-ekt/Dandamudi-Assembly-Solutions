Write a procedure to perform multiplication of matrices **A** and **B**. The procedure should receive pointers to the two input matrices (**A** of size $\mathrm{l×m}$, **B** of size $\mathrm{m×n}$), the product matrix **C**, and values $\mathrm{l}$, $\mathrm{m}$, and $\mathrm{n}$. Also, the data for the two matrices should be obtained from the user. Devise a suitable user interface to read these numbers.
