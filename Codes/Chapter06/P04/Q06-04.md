### Q06.04

Write a complete assembly language program to read two matrices **A** and **B** and display the result matrix **C**, which is the sum of **A** and **B**. Note that the elements of **C** can be obtained as

$\mathrm{C[i,j] = A[i,j] + B[i,j]}$

Your program should consist of a main procedure that calls the `read_matrix` procedure twice to read data for **A** and **B**. It should then call the `matrix_add` procedure, which receives pointers to **A**, **B**, **C**, and the size of the matrices. Note that both **A** and **B** should have the same size. The `main` procedure calls another procedure to display **C**.
