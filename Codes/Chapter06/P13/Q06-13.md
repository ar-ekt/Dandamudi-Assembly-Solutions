If we are given a square matrix (i.e., a matrix with equal number of rows and columns), we can classify it as the diagonal matrix if only its diagonal elements are nonzero; as an upper triangular matrix if all the elements below the diagonal are 0; and as a lower triangular matrix if all elements above the diagonal are 0. Some examples are: Diagonal matrix:
```
28, 0,  0,  0
0,  87, 0,  0
0,  0,  97, 0
0,  0,  0,  65
```
Upper triangular matrix:
```
19, 26, 35, 98
0,  78, 43, 65
0,  0 , 38, 29
0,  0,  0,  82
```

Lower triangular matrix:
```
76, 0,  0,  0
44, 38, 0,  0
65, 28, 89, 0
87, 56, 67, 54
```

Write an assembly language program to read a matrix and output the type of matrix.
