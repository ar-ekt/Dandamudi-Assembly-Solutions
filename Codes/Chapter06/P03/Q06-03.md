### Q06.03

Modify Program 6.4 to read marks from the user. The first number of the input indicates the number of students in class (i.e., number of rows), and the next number represents the number of tests given to the class (i.e., number of columns). Your program should be able to handle up to 20 students and 5 tests. Report error when exceeding these limits.

#### Example 6.4 Finding the sum of a column in a two-dimensional array.
Consider the `class_marks` array representing the test scores of a class. For simplicity, assume that there are only five students in the class. Also, assume that the class is given three tests. As we discussed before, we can use a 5 Ã— 3 array to store the marks. Each row represents the three test marks of a student in the class. The first column represents the marks of the first test; the second column represents the marks of the second test, and so on. The objective of this example is to find the sum of the last test marks for the class. The program listing is given in Program 6.4.

```
To access individual test marks, we use based-indexed addressing with a displacement on line 29. Note that even though we have used
```
[class_marks+EBX+ESI*2]
```
it is translated by the assembler as
```
[EBX+(ESI*2)+constant]
```
where the `constant` is the offset of `class_marks`. For this to work, the EBX should store the offset of the row in which we are interested. For this reason, after initializing the EBX to zero to point to the first row (line 26), `NO_ROW_BYTES` is added in the loop body (line 30). The ESI register is used as the column index. This works for row-major ordering.
