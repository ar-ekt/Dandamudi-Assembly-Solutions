### Q06.12

Modify the program for the last exercise to also generate a class summary stating the
number of students receiving each letter grade in the following format:
```
    A = number of students receiving A,
    B = number of students receiving B,
    C = number of students receiving C,
    D = number of students receiving D,	
    F = number of students receiving F.
```


#### Q06.11

Write a complete assembly language program to do the following:

 - Read the names of students in a class into a one-dimensional array.
 - Read test scores of each student into a two-dimensional marks array.
 - Output a letter grade for each student in the format:

``` 
student name          letter grade
```

You can use the following information in writing your program:
 - Assume that the maximum class size is 20.
 - Assume that the class is given four tests of equal weight (i.e., 25 points each).
 - Test marks are rounded to the nearest integer so you can treat them as integers.
 - Use the following table to convert percentage marks (i.e, sum of all four tests) to a letter grade.

| Marks range | Grade |
|:-----------:|:-----:|
| 85–100      | A     |
| 70–84	      | B     |
| 60–69       | C     |
| 50–59       | D     |
| 0–49        | F     |
