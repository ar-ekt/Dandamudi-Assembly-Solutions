Write a program to read a matrix of integers, perform cyclic permutation of rows, and display the result matrix. Cyclic permutation of a sequence $a0,a1,a2, . . . ,an−1$ is defined as $a1,a2, . . . ,an−1,a0$. Apply this process for each row of the matrix. Your program should be able to handle up to 12 × 15 matrices. If the input matrix is

```
12, 34, 56, 78
23, 45, 67, 89
34, 56, 78, 90
45, 67, 89, 10
```

, the permuted matrix is

```
34, 56, 78, 12
45, 67, 89, 23
56, 78, 90, 34
67, 89, 10, 45
```
