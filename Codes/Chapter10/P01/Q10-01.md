### Q10.1

Write a procedure `str_ncpy` to mimic the `strncpy` function provided by the C library.
The function `str_ncpy` receives two strings, `string1` and `string2`, and a
positive integer `num` via the stack. Of course, the procedure receives only the string
pointers, not the actual strings. It should copy at most the first `num` characters of
`string2` to `string1`.
