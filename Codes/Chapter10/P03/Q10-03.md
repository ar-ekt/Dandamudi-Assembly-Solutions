### Q10.3

A *palindrome* is a word, verse, sentence, or number that reads the same backward or
forward. Blanks, punctuation marks, and capitalization do not count in determining
palindromes. Here are some examples:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1991
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Able was I ere I saw Elba
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam! Iâ€™m Adam
Write a procedure to determine if a given string is a palindrome. The string is passed
via the stack (i.e., the string pointer is passed to the procedure). The procedure returns
1 in EAX if the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns 0. The carry flag is used to
indicate the *Not a string* error message, as we did in our examples in this chapter.
