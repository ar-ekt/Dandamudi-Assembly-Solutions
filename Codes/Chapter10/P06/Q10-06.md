### Q10.6

Write a procedure `str_str` that receives two pointers to strings `string` and `substring` via the stack and searches for `substring` in `string`. If a match is found, it returns in EAX the starting position of the first match. Matching should be case sensitive. A negative value is returned in EAX if no match is found. For example,
if
```
string =  Good things come in small packages.
```
and
```
substring = in
```
the procedure should return 8 in EAX, indicating a match of `in` in `things`.
