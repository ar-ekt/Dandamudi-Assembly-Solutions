### Q10.2

Write a procedure `str_ncmp` to mimic the C function `strncmp`. The parameters passed to this function are the same as those of `str_ncpy`. It should compare at most the first `num` characters of the two strings and return a positive, negative, or 0 value like the `str_cmp` procedure does.
