### Q7.3

Repeat the above exercise with the following modificationâ€”use multiplication instead of addition. Here is an example:

```
		7391928 = 7 * 3 * 9 * 1 * 9 * 2 * 8 = 27216
		27216 = 2 * 7 * 2 * 1 * 6 = 168
		168 = 1 * 6 * 8 = 48
		48 = 4 * 8 = 32
		32 = 3 * 2 = 6.
```

#### Above Exercise (Q7.2)

Suppose you are given a positive integer. You can add individual digits of this number to get another integer. Now apply the same procedure to the new integer. If we repeat this procedure, eventually we will end up with a single digit. Here is an example:

```
		7391928 = 7 + 3 + 9 + 1 + 9 + 2 + 8 = 39
		39 = 3 + 9 = 12
		12 = 1 + 2 = 3.
```

Write a program that reads a positive integer from the user and displays the single digit as obtained by the above procedure. For the example, the output should be 3.

Your program should detect negative input as an error and terminate after displaying an appropriate error message.
