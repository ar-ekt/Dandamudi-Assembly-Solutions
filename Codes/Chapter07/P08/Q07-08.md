### Q7.8

Modify the above program to round the average test score. For example, if the average is 15.55, it should be rounded to 16.

#### Above Exercise (Q7.7)

Write a program that reads a set of test scores as input and outputs the truncated average value (i.e., discard any fraction generated). The input test scores cannot be negative. So use this condition to terminate the input. Furthermore, assume that the first number entered is not the test score but the maximum score that can be obtained for that test. Use this information to display the average test score as a percentage. For example, if the average is 18 and the maximum obtainable test score is 20, the average is 90%.
